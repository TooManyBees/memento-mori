# Memento Mori

This repository is a meditation on death.

Not the resulting computer program, the project itself.

			The water in your body is just visiting.<br>
			It was a thunderstorm a week ago.<br>
			It will be an ocean soon enough.<br>
			Most of your cells come and go like morning dew.<br>
			We are more weather pattern than stone monument.<br>
			Sunlight on mist. Summer lightning.<br>
			Your Choices outweight your substance.

A few years ago, I crossed paths with this video on a social media feed, part of the Journey to the Microcosmos series: [This Ciliate is About to Die (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibpdNqrtar0). In it, narrator Hank Green guides the audience through a ciliate's final minutes of life, as we watch its body slowly disintegrate. The video focuses on a specific theme, a definition of life as a system that uses its energy to keep itself from reaching equilibrium, and the complementary definition of death as the moment when the system stops working.

I have lately tended to describe life as "a pattern made out of chaos", where life is like a preposterously unlikely juggling act that shapes chaos into something that resembles order, if you squint at it, but couldn't be farther from it. So I didn't need convincing to believe the video's claim.

Some time later, on that same social media feed, I stumbled upon [Don Hopkins's CAM6 Demo (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyLMHxRNuck), a video in which Don Hopkins, with overflowing enthusiasm, demonstrates his web browser simulator for the [Cam-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam-6). The Cam-6 is a computer expansion board from the 1980s, designed to run [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata). Don's narration doesn't slow down for such trivialities as "what is a cellular automaton?", and his focus never stays in the same place long enough to explain much anyway, but one thing you need to know about me is that I love anyone eagerly talking shop about something they love.

About 5 minutes in, when he says "[Rudy Rucker](https://www.rudyrucker.com) came up with a nifty idea of combining Brian's Brain together with Life and one called Annealâ€¦" is when I saw the shape of an organism declaring a boundary between itself and its surroundings, and began to draw some parallels.

I want to think a bit about systems that tend away from equilibrium, and the semi-arbitrary distinctions that most of us make between life and death, between "somethings" that are a part of a system and other "somethings" that aren't part of a system, and the moment when we change our determination about what is or isn't alive.

## How to run this program

You can't, because I haven't released `rust-nite2`. Sucks to be youuuu
